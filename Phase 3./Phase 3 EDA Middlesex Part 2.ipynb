b ) being untruthful ; and two charges related to c ) not filing a timely and accur ate report after using a weapon . ameral was also charged with : a ) falsifying records ; and b ) being untruthful ; in addition to c ) leaving an assigned area without permission ; and d ) neglect of duty . the two cases were consolidated as they relate to the same incident . the appeals regarding these two cases were timely filed . a hearing was held on august 28 , 2006 at the offices of the civil service commission . as no written notice was receiv ed from either party , the hearing was declared private . three tapes were made of the hearing . findings of fact : based upon the documents entered into evidence ( joi nt exhibits 1 & 2 ; appointing authority exhibits 3-61 ; and appellant exhibits 62- 65 ) and the testimony of : for the appointing authority : /square4 somerville police captain john o ’ connor ; for the appellant : /square4 officer michael kiely , appellant ; /square4 officer michael ameral , appellant ; i make the following findings of fact : 1 . appellant michael kiely was a tenured civil service employee in the posit ion of police officer with the somerville police departmen t on january 18 , 2003 and had been employed in that position for eight ( 8 ) years . he served as vice president of the 3 local police union from 1998 through 2002 and descr ibed his relationship with the then-police chief as “ hostile ” as a result of sever al union-management issues involving budgetary matters . he had no record of di scipline prior to january 18 , 2003 . ( testimony of appellant kiely ) 2 . appellant michael ameral was also a tenured civil service employee in the po sition of police officer with the somerville police depart ment on january 18 , 2003 and had been employed in that position for seventeen ( 17 ) y ears . ameral had just recently succeeded kiely as vice president of the local poli ce union in january 2003 and concurred with kiely that there was a contentious r elationship between the union and management at the time of the incident . ameral had received a written reprimand one month earlier for being out of his sector witho ut permission . ( testimony of ameral ) 3 . officer kiely was assigned to a detail duty from 9 : 00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on january 18 , 2003 at the east cambridge savings bank on the corner of highland avenue and cedar street in somerville , ma . ( testimony of kiely , exhibits 1 & 12 ) 4 . officer ameral was working a tour of duty in ward 2 on january 18 , 2003 but had been given permission to attend a meeting at city h all concerning the police department ’ s budget . at the conclusion of the meet ing at city hall , ameral , the newly-elected union vice president , drove to the ea st cambridge savings bank to discuss what happened at the meeting with kiely , th e now-former union vice president , who was on detail duty at the bank . the bank is located in ward 5 , 4 approximately 3/10 of a mile outside the ward that ameral was assigned to that day ( ward 2 ) . ( testimony of ameral , exhibits 2 & 15 ) 5 . officer kiely did not have permission to go outside of ward 2 at the conclusion of the city hall meeting . ( exhibit 19 ) 6 . somerville police department general order 97-7 , se ction j states , “ officers are not to leave their assigned areas without permission fr om the street supervisor or the shift commander. ” ( exhibit 56 ) 7 . exactly how far away ameral parked his car from the bank that morning when he went to visit kiely would become an important issue at the commission hearing in regard to the veracity of the appellants ’ testimony , particularly ameral ’ s . the bank is located on the corner of highland avenue and ced ar street and the entrance to the bank faces highland avenue . there is no dispute th at ameral , when arriving to see kiely , parked his car somewhere down on cedar stree t. 8 . captain o ’ connor , who testified on behalf of the ap pointing authority at the commission hearing , measured the distance from the bank ’ s front entrance on highland avenue to the corner of cedar street ( 33 f eet ) and then measured the nearest location where ameral ’ s car could have been parked on cedar street ( an additional 75 feet ) . ( testimony of o ’ connor and exh ibit 59 ) 9 . officers ameral and kiely conversed in the bank fro m approximately 11:00 a.m. to 11:38 a.m . both officers were monitoring their police radio s while in the bank . ( testimony of kiely and ameral ; exhibits 1 , 12 and 19 ) 5 10 . at approximately 11:35 a.m. , the somerville police department received a radio transmission from the cambridge police department i ndicating that the cambridge police were pursuing a gray honda which was believe d to be a stolen vehicle . the somerville police dispatch broadcast this informati on to all units , including officers kiely and ameral , at 11:36:49 a.m. ( exhibit 62 ) 11 . nine ( 9 ) members of the somerville police department ( other than the appellants ) were monitoring their police radios at the time and filed written reports with the somerville police department regarding their recoll ection and/or involvement with the vehicle chase that day . ( exhibits 21-24 ; 26 & 2 7 ; 30 , 32 & 33 ) 12 . at least six of the officers who wrote the above-re ferenced reports explicitly referenced in their reports that they remember hear ing on the radio that the stolen vehicle was headed into or toward union square in somerville . while diffe rent streets are referenced in the reports as to where t he stolen vehicle was at any given time , all of the streets referenced in the reports are in very close proximity to the intersection of highland avenue and cedar street , t he location of the east cambridge savings bank , where both of the appellants were loc ated . ( exhibits 21-24 ; 26 & 27 ; 30 , 32 & 33 ) 13 . there is no dispute that at some point , the pursuit of the stolen vehicle was subsequently called off by the somerville police de partment . 14 . both officers ameral and kiely testified before the commission that they heard the initial radio transmission regarding the pursuit of the stolen vehicle . ( testimony of appellants ameral and kiely ) 6 15 . key parts of the testimony offered by officer amera l at the commission hearing in regard to what happened after they initially heard the radio transmission about the pursuit of the stolen vehicle are inconsistent , not plausible and unsupported by the evidence . 16 . officer ameral testified before the commission that he left the b ank before officer kiely left and walked back to his car parked down on ced ar street , based on his purported belief that the stolen car was headed away from the bank and union square . according to officer ameral , he was back i n his car down on cedar street when he heard the sound of gunshots . ( testimony of ameral ) 17 . officer kiely , who heard the exact same radio transmission , test ified that he exited the bank ten to fifteen seconds after ameral , order ed pedestrians out of the cross walk , looked easterly on highland avenue and heard the sound of an accelerating engine . a car started speeding toward officer kiel y and he put his hand up in an attempt to get the driver of the vehicle to stop . the speeding car started closing in on officer kiely and kiely fired his gun in an attempt to shoot the driver of the car . some of the bullets fired hit a building across the street . it was the first time officer kiely had discharged his weapon in a non-training e nvironment during his tenure as a police officer . even though kiely ’ s testimony come s three years after the incident , it was clear from his emotional testimony that this wa s a harrowing , life-threatening event that he will never forget and for which he ha s a vivid , detailed recollection . ( testimony of kiely ) 7 18 . on february 5 , 2003 , less than 30 days after the incident in question , officer kiely was interviewed by captain o ’ connor . during that i nterview , officer kiely stated that , “ a couple of seconds ” after the shooting , he saw officer ameral standing on the sidewalk trying to get his attention . during his t estimony before the commission , kiely confirmed that he saw ameral standing there a bout two seconds after the shooting . ( testimony of appellant kiely ) 19 . kiely ’ s testimony directly contradicts that of amer al . ameral testified before the commission that he was sitting in his car , parked d own on cedar street , when he heard the sound of gunshots . absent some super natu ral abilities , it is simply not possible that ameral was able to get out of his car and walk , run or otherwise transport himself back to the scene -- 75 feet away- - in two seconds . what is more likely , based on the evidence and the testimony of kiely , is that ameral never went back to his car at all -- -and was actually present for the entire incident , including kiely ’ s attempt to stop the driver of the stolen ve hicle by shooting at him . 20 . ameral ’ s credibility was further undermined by his testimony that , after purportedly making it back to the location in front of the bank where he believed shots may have been fired , he simply asked officer kiely , “ are you alright , need any help ? ” . upon seeing officer kiely waiving him off , ameral testif ied that he went back to his car on cedar street without asking even one question about the sound of gun shots . in his interview with captain o ’ connor on february 4 , 2003 , ameral stated that he thought , “ either they shot at him ( kiely ) or he shot at them or there was no shot it was just the vehicle striking something. ” ( testimony of ameral ) 8 21 . ameral , having fired his weapon in the line of duty for the first time in his career , testified that he was seriously shaken by the incid ent , was nauseas , and vomited twice at his mother ’ s house shortly after the incident . ( testimony of ameral and kiely ) 22 . based on a call from officer kiely , lt. polito of t he somerville police department arrived at the scene . polito ’ s report indicates th at upon arriving at the scene , kiely handed over his gun voluntarily and that kiely look ed , “ somewhat disoriented and a bit dazed at what had just happened. ” ( exhibit 32 ) 23 . while at the scene on the day of the incident on ja nuary 18 , 2003 , lt. polito ordered officer kiely to “ file a station report explaining his actions regarding what had occurred. ” ( exhibit 32 ) 24 . captain matthews of the somerville police departmen t also arrived at the scene of the incident on january 18 , 2003 , and instructed ki ely “ to go home , gather himself , and file a report right away ” . ( exhibit 49 ) 25 . lt. polito spoke again with officer kiely the next morning , sunday , january 19 , 2003 . according to a statement from lt. polito , “ i asked him how he was doing and told him i needed his written report regarding what had occurred involving his actions . he ( kiely ) informed me that he would be i n to file his report this evening ” . ( exhibit 32 ) 26 . consistent with standard procedure , kiely was relie ved of duty on the day of the incident , january 18 , 2003 . he sought medical trea tment and was ordered home by his personal physician . january 19 , 2003 was kiely ’ s regular day off and he was scheduled to return to duty at midnight and begin a tour of duty at 12:01 a.m. on 9 january 21 , 2003 , but called in sick . he also calle d in sick on january 22 , 2003 , but did file his report that day ( january 22 , 2003 ) . ( t estimony of kiely ) 27 . section f , rule 30 of the somerville police departm ent rules and regulations requires all officers to “ promptly and accurately c omplete and submit all reports and forms as required by department procedures. ” ( exhib it 55 ) 28 . in his report filed on january 22 , 2003 , officer ki ely offered a detailed account of what transpired on january 18 , 2003 , including refe rences to his detail duty , with one glaring omission : there is not one reference to officer ameral being in , near or around the bank that day . kiely repeatedly uses th e pronoun “ i ” in his written report when describing even the most routine events that m orning in which “ we ” is clearly more accurate , including , “ i was standing inside the lobby of the bank ” . in fa ct , it is undisputed that officer ameral was standing inside the bank with officer kiely . ( exhibit 1 ) 29 . officer kiely never mentioned that officer ameral w as present on january 18 , 2003 to any of the numerous officers and superiors who r esponded to the shooting . ( testimony of captain o ’ connor ) 30 . during the course of his investigation , captain o ’ c onnor ordered all personnel who had been on patrol duty during the incident to file reports . on january 25 , 2003 , three days after kiely filed his report , officer ameral f iled a report describing his activities during the time when officer kiley fired his weapon on january 18 th . officer ameral indicated in his report that he had been at or near the scene when officer kiley fired the shots . this was the first time that captain o ’ connor became aware that officer 10 ameral had been present with officer kiley in the b ank during the stolen car chase . ( exhibit 2 , testimony of captain o ’ connor ) 31 . in his january 25 th report , ameral stated in part “ minutes before 11:3 0 a.m . i departed the east cambridge saving bank. ” ( emphasi s added ) it is undisputed , however that the original radio transmission regard ing the pursuit of the stolen vehicle did not come in until 11:36:49 a.m . and it is undisputed that officer kiely did not exit the bank until after 11:36:49 a.m . since kiely testified before the commission that ameral only left the bank “ 10 – 15 seconds ” before him , ameral ’ s statement can not be true . further , exhibit 16 is a picture captured by the bank security camera at 11:38:10 a.m. on january 18 , 200 3 – and officer ameral is standing in the bank lobby with officer kiely . ( exh ibit 2 , exhibit 16 ) 32 . section f , rule 34 of the somerville police departm ent rules and regulations requires an officer to “ truthfully state the facts in all reports as well as when he appears before any judicial , departmental or other official investigation , hearing , trial or proceeding . he shall cooperate fully in all pha ses of such investigations , hearing , trial and proceedings ” ( exhibit 55 ) 33 . officer kiely was charged with : a ) falsifying reco rds ; b ) being untruthful ; and two charges related to c ) not filing a timely and accur ate report after using a weapon and was suspended for fifteen ( 15 ) days . ( exhibit 3 ) 34 . officer ameral was also charged with : a ) falsifyin g records ; and b ) being untruthful ; in addition to c ) leaving an assigned area without permission ; and d ) neglect of duty . ( exhibit 4 ) 11 35 . both appellants filed a timely appeal with the civi l service commission and the appeals were consolidated . ( exhibits 64 & 65 ) conclusion the role of the civil service commission is to dete rmine `` whether the appointing authority has sustained its burden of proving that there was reasonable justification for the action taken by the appointing authority .

'' watertown v. arria , 16 mass . app . ct. 331 , 334 ( 1983 ) . see commissioners of civil serv . v. municipal ct. of bo ston , 369 mass . 84 , 86 ( 1975 ) and leominster v. stratton , 58 mass . app . ct. 726 , 727-728 ( 2003 ) . in january 2003 , the city of somerville and the pol ice union had a strained relationship as a result of fiscal problems . the r elationship between the local police union and the then-police chief was acrimonious , in cluding the relationship between the police chief and the two appellants . officer kiely , was the outgoing police union vice president and officer ameral was the incoming polic e union vice president . on january 18 , 2003 , officer ameral , in his role as union vice president , attended a meeting at city hall in regard to budget issues . i nstead of returning to his assigned sector after the meeting , ameral went outside of hi s sector ( without permission ) to speak with officer kiely , who was working a detail assign ment at the east cambridge savings bank , located on the corner of highland avenue and cedar street in somerville . 13 approximately one month prior to the incident which occurred on january 18 , 2003 , officer ameral had been disciplined for going outsi de his sector without permission . while the appellants were conversing inside the ea st cambridge savings bank on the morning of january 18 , 2003 , a radio transmissi on was issued indicating that the cambridge police were pursuing a stolen vehicle int o somerville toward union square . all streets referenced in the radio transmission we re in close proximity to the east cambridge savings bank . officer ameral asks the commission to believe that , in response to these radio transmissions , he left the east cambridge savings b ank and walked back to his car parked over seventy ( 70 ) feet down cedar street . a ccording to ameral , once he was back in his car , he heard a sound which he assumed was gunshots . he then purportedly went back to the corner of highland avenue and ceda r street . officer ameral then testified incredulously before the commission that he simply asked kiely if he was alright and , upon being waived off by kiely , walked back to his car and drove away – never once asking kiely about the gunshots , if kiel y himself had been shot at or whether kiely had fired shots . on its face , this testimony is absurdly incredulous . further , other evidence presented and the testimony of officer kie ly confirms that ameral is simply not telling the truth . in a report filed one week afte r the incident , ameral stated that he left the bank minutes before 11:30 a.m. – which would ha ve meant he left well before hearing the radio transmission . pictures captured by the bank ’ s security video , submitted as evidence by the appointing authority , put both k iely and ameral in the bank at least until 11:38:10 a.m. , offering irrefutable evidence that ameral is not telling the truth about what time he walked out of the bank that morn ing . further , even officer kiely 14 testified before the commission that he saw officer ameral standing on the sidewalk outside the bank two seconds after he stepped into the road and fired his gun a t the speeding vehicle . in order for ameral ’ s version of events to be remotely true , he ( ameral ) would need to have gotten out of his car a nd walked or run 70 feet up cedar street toward highland avenue in two seconds . cognizant that his fellow officer ( ameral ) had been disciplined by management approximately one month earlier for leaving his sec tor without permission , officer kiely waited three days to fill out a report regarding th e incident , and once he did , failed to mention even once that officer ameral was present t hat morning at the bank , outside of his assigned sector . an appointing authority is well within its rights t o take disciplinary action when a police officer has “ a demonstrated willingness to f udge the truth in exigent circumstances ” because “ [ p ] olice work frequently ca lls upon officers to speak the truth when doing so might put into question a search or m ight embarrass a fellow officer. ” see town of falmouth v. civil service commission , 61 mass . app . ct. 796 , 801 ( 2004 ) ; citing city of cambridge , supra at 303 . by a preponderance of the evidence , the appointing authority has shown that officer kiely sought to conceal the fact that officer amera l was at the bank , out of his sector , when the incident in question occurred on january 1 8 , 2003 by failing to indicate that officer ameral was present in the written report he submitted to the somerville police department . in doing so , he was not truthful and h e violated the rules and regulations regarding truthfulness and filing accurate reports . while there is a strong suspicion that 15 kiely deliberately waited four days to file his rep ort in order to coordinate his response with ameral , which would support the charge related to kiely not filing a timely report , the appointing authority did not prove this . furth er , kiely was clearly shaken by the shooting that day , appropriately sought medical att ention and was out sick for two days after the incident , all mitigating factors in deter mining whether or not the report was filed in a timely manner . the underpinning of this case , however , is not whether or not the report in question was filed in a timely manner . r ather , the underlying question is whether or not the report was accurate , complete an d truthful . it was not . as such , the 15-day suspension should not be disturbed solely be cause the appointing authority failed to show that kiely ’ s report was untimely . the most troubling aspect of this case , however , is the untruthfulness of michael ameral . the irrefutable evidence , and even the testimony of kiely , show that ameral ’ s version of events regarding the morning of septembe r 18 , 2003 is simply not true . by a preponderance of the evidence , the appointing autho rity has shown that kiely was untruthful , falsified records , and was out of his s ector without permission that day . for all of the above-reasons , the appellants ’ appeals under docket numbers d-03-289 and d-03-292 are hereby dismissed . civil service commission ________________________________ christopher c. bowman , chairman by

dante difronzo spoke with a confidential informant ( “ ci ” ) . the ci told det . difronzo that an individual ( “ the individual ” ) , whom detective difronzo was searching for in conjunction with an unrelated investigation , had recently stolen marijuana from the ci . detective difronzo knew that the ci had a violent criminal past and that the ci was looking for the individual . the ci told det . difronzo that he intended to harm the individual . detective difronzo , with this knowledge , actively assisted the ci in locating the individual by providing information to the ci regarding the individual ’ s whereabouts . after receiving this information from det . difronzo , the ci participated in the aforementioned home invasion , in which the individual was stabbed multiple times with a machete requiring hospitalization and surgeries . the commonwealth is also aware that detective difronzo knowingly made material omissions in police reports that were submitted in connection with the investigation of the home invasion . an internal affairs investigation , initiated in may 2017 as a result of this disclosure , found several violations of the internal rules and regulations of the somerville police department , specifically that detective difronzo : did not promptly submit a complete police report , submitted a false or inaccurate police report , withheld evidence and was untruthful , exhibited conduct unbecoming an officer , and engaged in an improper association with a street source . on may 7 , 2018 , detective difronzo was terminated from the somerville police department . on june 4 , 2021 , an arbitrator concluded that several of the investigation ’ s findings – specifically that detective difronzo withheld evidence and engaged in improper association – were not supported by a preponderance of the evidence , and overturned detective difronzo ’ s termination . the arbitrator retroactively imposed a 2roughly three-year suspension dating from the original date of termination to the date of the arbitrator ’ s decision , and determined that detective difronzo should not receive back pay or benefits for that period . the commonwealth possesses

hereafter , “ kiely ” , “ ameral ” or “ ap pellants ” ) , are appealing the 2 decision of the somerville police department ( herea fter “ city ” or “ appointing authority ” ) suspending them each for fifteen ( 15 ) days for violating various rules of the somerville police department revolving around an in cident that occurred on january 18 , 2003 . kiely was charged with : a ) falsifying records ; b ) being untruthful ; and two charges related to c ) not filing a timely and accur ate report after using a weapon . ameral was also charged with : a ) falsifying records ; and b ) being untruthful ; in addition to c ) leaving an assigned area without permission ; and d ) neglect of duty . the two cases were consolidated as they relate to the same incident . the appeals regarding these two cases were timely filed . a hearing was held on august 28 , 2006 at the offices of the civil service commission . as no written notice was receiv ed from either party , the hearing was declared private . three tapes were made of the hearing . findings of fact : based upon the documents entered into evidence ( joi nt exhibits 1 & 2 ; appointing authority exhibits 3-61 ; and appellant exhibits 62- 65 ) and the testimony of : for the appointing authority : /square4 somerville police captain john o ’ connor ; for the appellant : /square4 officer michael kiely , appellant ; /square4 officer michael ameral , appellant ; i make the following findings of fact : 1 . appellant michael kiely was a tenured civil service employee in the posit ion of police officer with the somerville police departmen t on january 18 , 2003 and had been employed in that position for eight ( 8 ) years . he served as vice president of the 3 local police union from 1998 through 2002 and descr ibed his relationship with the then-police chief as “ hostile ” as a result of sever al union-management issues involving budgetary matters . he had no record of di scipline prior to january 18 , 2003 . ( testimony of appellant kiely ) 2 . appellant michael ameral was also a tenured civil service employee in the po sition of police officer with the somerville police depart ment on january 18 , 2003 and had been employed in that position for seventeen ( 17 ) y ears . ameral had just recently succeeded kiely as vice president of the local poli ce union in january 2003 and concurred with kiely that there was a contentious r elationship between the union and management at the time of the incident . ameral had received a written reprimand one month earlier for being out of his sector witho ut permission . ( testimony of ameral ) 3 . officer kiely was assigned to a detail duty from 9 : 00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on january 18 , 2003 at the east cambridge savings bank on the corner of highland avenue and cedar street in somerville , ma . ( testimony of kiely , exhibits 1 & 12 ) 4 . officer ameral was working a tour of duty in ward 2 on january 18 , 2003 but had been given permission to attend a meeting at city h all concerning the police department ’ s budget . at the conclusion of the meet ing at city hall , ameral , the newly-elected union vice president , drove to the ea st cambridge savings bank to discuss what happened at the meeting with kiely , th e now-former union vice president , who was on detail duty at the bank . the bank is located in ward 5 , 4 approximately 3/10 of a mile outside the ward that ameral was assigned to that day ( ward 2 ) . ( testimony of ameral , exhibits 2 & 15 ) 5 . officer kiely did not have permission to go outside of ward 2 at the conclusion of the city hall meeting . ( exhibit 19 ) 6 . somerville police department general order 97-7 , se ction j states , “ officers are not to leave their assigned areas without permission fr om the street supervisor or the shift commander. ” ( exhibit 56 ) 7 . exactly how far away ameral parked his car from the bank that morning when he went to visit kiely would become an important issue at the commission hearing in regard to the veracity of the appellants ’ testimony , particularly ameral ’ s . the bank is located on the corner of highland avenue and ced ar street and the entrance to the bank faces highland avenue . there is no dispute th at ameral , when arriving to see kiely , parked his car somewhere down on cedar stree t. 8 . captain o ’ connor , who testified on behalf of the ap pointing authority at the commission hearing , measured the distance from the bank ’ s front entrance on highland avenue to the corner of cedar street ( 33 f eet ) and then measured the nearest location where ameral ’ s car could have been parked on cedar street ( an additional 75 feet ) . ( testimony of o ’ connor and exh ibit 59 ) 9 . officers ameral and kiely conversed in the bank fro m approximately 11:00 a.m. to 11:38 a.m . both officers were monitoring their police radio s while in the bank . ( testimony of kiely and ameral ; exhibits 1 , 12 and 19 ) 5 10 . at approximately 11:35 a.m. , the somerville police department received a radio transmission from the cambridge police department i ndicating that the cambridge police were pursuing a gray honda which was believe d to be a stolen vehicle . the somerville police dispatch broadcast this informati on to all units , including officers kiely and ameral , at 11:36:49 a.m. ( exhibit 62 ) 11 . nine ( 9 ) members of the somerville police department ( other than the appellants ) were monitoring their police radios at the time and filed written reports with the somerville police department regarding their recoll ection and/or involvement with the vehicle chase that day . ( exhibits 21-24 ; 26 & 2 7 ; 30 , 32 & 33 ) 12 . at least six of the officers who wrote the above-re ferenced reports explicitly referenced in their reports that they remember hear ing on the radio that the stolen vehicle was headed into or toward union square in somerville . while diffe rent streets are referenced in the reports as to where t he stolen vehicle was at any given time , all of the streets referenced in the reports are in very close proximity to the intersection of highland avenue and cedar street , t he location of the east cambridge savings bank , where both of the appellants were loc ated . ( exhibits 21-24 ; 26 & 27 ; 30 , 32 & 33 ) 13 . there is no dispute that at some point , the pursuit of the stolen vehicle was subsequently called off by the somerville police de partment . 14 . both officers ameral and kiely testified before the commission that they heard the initial radio transmission regarding the pursuit of the stolen vehicle . ( testimony of appellants ameral and kiely ) 6 15 . key parts of the testimony offered by officer amera l at the commission hearing in regard to what happened after they initially heard the radio transmission about the pursuit of the stolen vehicle are inconsistent , not plausible and unsupported by the evidence . 16 . officer ameral testified before the commission that he left the b ank before officer kiely left and walked back to his car parked down on ced ar street , based on his purported belief that the stolen car was headed away from the bank and union square . according to officer ameral , he was back i n his car down on cedar street when he heard the sound of gunshots . ( testimony of ameral ) 17 . officer kiely , who heard the exact same radio transmission , test ified that he exited the bank ten to fifteen seconds after ameral , order ed pedestrians out of the cross walk , looked easterly on highland avenue and heard the sound of an accelerating engine . a car started speeding toward officer kiel y and he put his hand up in an attempt to get the driver of the vehicle to stop . the speeding car started closing in on officer kiely and kiely fired his gun in an attempt to shoot the driver of the car . some of the bullets fired hit a building across the street . it was the first time officer kiely had discharged his weapon in a non-training e nvironment during his tenure as a police officer . even though kiely ’ s testimony come s three years after the incident , it was clear from his emotional testimony that this wa s a harrowing , life-threatening event that he will never forget and for which he ha s a vivid , detailed recollection . ( testimony of kiely ) 7 18 . on february 5 , 2003 , less than 30 days after the incident in question , officer kiely was interviewed by captain o ’ connor . during that i nterview , officer kiely stated that , “ a couple of seconds ” after the shooting , he saw officer ameral standing on the sidewalk trying to get his attention . during his t estimony before the commission , kiely confirmed that he saw ameral standing there a bout two seconds after the shooting . ( testimony of appellant kiely ) 19 . kiely ’ s testimony directly contradicts that of amer al . ameral testified before the commission that he was sitting in his car , parked d own on cedar street , when he heard the sound of gunshots . absent some super natu ral abilities , it is simply not possible that ameral was able to get out of his car and walk , run or otherwise transport himself back to the scene -- 75 feet away- - in two seconds . what is more likely , based on the evidence and the testimony of kiely , is that ameral never went back to his car at all -- -and was actually present for the entire incident , including kiely ’ s attempt to stop the driver of the stolen ve hicle by shooting at him . 20 . ameral ’ s credibility was further undermined by his testimony that , after purportedly making it back to the location in front of the bank where he believed shots may have been fired , he simply asked officer kiely , “ are you alright , need any help ? ” . upon seeing officer kiely waiving him off , ameral testif ied that he went back to his car on cedar street without asking even one question about the sound of gun shots . in his interview with captain o ’ connor on february 4 , 2003 , ameral stated that he thought , “ either they shot at him ( kiely ) or he shot at them or there was no shot it was just the vehicle striking something. ” ( testimony of ameral ) 8 21 . ameral , having fired his weapon in the line of duty for the first time in his career , testified that he was seriously shaken by the incid ent , was nauseas , and vomited twice at his mother ’ s house shortly after the incident . ( testimony of ameral and kiely ) 22 . based on a call from officer kiely , lt. polito of t he somerville police department arrived at the scene . polito ’ s report indicates th at upon arriving at the scene , kiely handed over his gun voluntarily and that kiely look ed , “ somewhat disoriented and a bit dazed at what had just happened. ” ( exhibit 32 ) 23 . while at the scene on the day of the incident on ja nuary 18 , 2003 , lt. polito ordered officer kiely to “ file a station report explaining his actions regarding what had occurred. ” ( exhibit 32 ) 24 . captain matthews of the somerville police departmen t also arrived at the scene of the incident on january 18 , 2003 , and instructed ki ely “ to go home , gather himself , and file a report right away ” . ( exhibit 49 ) 25 . lt. polito spoke again with officer kiely the next morning , sunday , january 19 , 2003 . according to a statement from lt. polito , “ i asked him how he was doing and told him i needed his written report regarding what had occurred involving his actions . he ( kiely ) informed me that he would be i n to file his report this evening ” . ( exhibit 32 ) 26 . consistent with standard procedure , kiely was relie ved of duty on the day of the incident , january 18 , 2003 . he sought medical trea tment and was ordered home by his personal physician . january 19 , 2003 was kiely ’ s regular day off and he was scheduled to return to duty at midnight and begin a tour of duty at 12:01 a.m. on 9 january 21 , 2003 , but called in sick . he also calle d in sick on january 22 , 2003 , but did file his report that day ( january 22 , 2003 ) . ( t estimony of kiely ) 27 . section f , rule 30 of the somerville police departm ent rules and regulations requires all officers to “ promptly and accurately c omplete and submit all reports and forms as required by department procedures. ” ( exhib it 55 ) 28 . in his report filed on january 22 , 2003 , officer ki ely offered a detailed account of what transpired on january 18 , 2003 , including refe rences to his detail duty , with one glaring omission : there is not one reference to officer ameral being in , near or around the bank that day . kiely repeatedly uses th e pronoun “ i ” in his written report when describing even the most routine events that m orning in which “ we ” is clearly more accurate , including , “ i was standing inside the lobby of the bank ” . in fa ct , it is undisputed that officer ameral was standing inside the bank with officer kiely . ( exhibit 1 ) 29 . officer kiely never mentioned that officer ameral w as present on january 18 , 2003 to any of the numerous officers and superiors who r esponded to the shooting . ( testimony of captain o ’ connor ) 30 . during the course of his investigation , captain o ’ c onnor ordered all personnel who had been on patrol duty during the incident to file reports . on january 25 , 2003 , three days after kiely filed his report , officer ameral f iled a report describing his activities during the time when officer kiley fired his weapon on january 18 th . officer ameral indicated in his report that he had been at or near the scene when officer kiley fired the shots . this was the first time that captain o ’ connor became aware that officer 10 ameral had been present with officer kiley in the b ank during the stolen car chase . ( exhibit 2 , testimony of captain o ’ connor ) 31 . in his january 25 th report , ameral stated in part “ minutes before 11:3 0 a.m . i departed the east cambridge saving bank. ” ( emphasi s added ) it is undisputed , however that the original radio transmission regard ing the pursuit of the stolen vehicle did not come in until 11:36:49 a.m . and it is undisputed that officer kiely did not exit the bank until after 11:36:49 a.m . since kiely testified before the commission that ameral only left the bank “ 10 – 15 seconds ” before him , ameral ’ s statement can not be true . further , exhibit 16 is a picture captured by the bank security camera at 11:38:10 a.m. on january 18 , 200 3 – and officer ameral is standing in the bank lobby with officer kiely . ( exh ibit 2 , exhibit 16 ) 32 . section f , rule 34 of the somerville police departm ent rules and regulations requires an officer to “ truthfully state the facts in all reports as well as when he appears before any judicial , departmental or other official investigation , hearing , trial or proceeding . he shall cooperate fully in all pha ses of such investigations , hearing , trial and proceedings ” ( exhibit 55 ) 33 . officer kiely was charged with : a ) falsifying reco rds ; b ) being untruthful ; and two charges related to c ) not filing a timely and accur ate report after using a weapon and was suspended for fifteen ( 15 ) days . ( exhibit 3 ) 34 . officer ameral was also charged with : a ) falsifyin g records ; and b ) being untruthful ; in addition to c ) leaving an assigned area without permission ; and d ) neglect of duty . ( exhibit 4 ) 11 35 . both appellants filed a timely appeal with the civi l service commission and the appeals were consolidated . ( exhibits 64 & 65 ) conclusion the role of the civil service commission is to dete rmine `` whether the appointing authority has sustained its burden of proving that there was reasonable justification for the action taken by the appointing authority .

. ct. 726 , 727-728 ( 2003 ) . in january 2003 , the city of somerville and the pol ice union had a strained relationship as a result of fiscal problems . the r elationship between the local police union and the then-police chief was acrimonious , in cluding the relationship between the police chief and the two appellants . officer kiely , was the outgoing police union vice president and officer ameral was the incoming polic e union vice president . on january 18 , 2003 , officer ameral , in his role as union vice president , attended a meeting at city hall in regard to budget issues . i nstead of returning to his assigned sector after the meeting , ameral went outside of hi s sector ( without permission ) to speak with officer kiely , who was working a detail assign ment at the east cambridge savings bank , located on the corner of highland avenue and cedar street in somerville . 13 approximately one month prior to the incident which occurred on january 18 , 2003 , officer ameral had been disciplined for going outsi de his sector without permission . while the appellants were conversing inside the ea st cambridge savings bank on the morning of january 18 , 2003 , a radio transmissi on was issued indicating that the cambridge police were pursuing a stolen vehicle int o somerville toward union square . all streets referenced in the radio transmission we re in close proximity to the east cambridge savings bank . officer ameral asks the commission to believe that , in response to these radio transmissions , he left the east cambridge savings b ank and walked back to his car parked over seventy ( 70 ) feet down cedar street . a ccording to ameral , once he was back in his car , he heard a sound which he assumed was gunshots . he then purportedly went back to the corner of highland avenue and ceda r street . officer ameral then testified incredulously before the commission that he simply asked kiely if he was alright and , upon being waived off by kiely , walked back to his car and drove away – never once asking kiely about the gunshots , if kiel y himself had been shot at or whether kiely had fired shots . on its face , this testimony is absurdly incredulous . further , other evidence presented and the testimony of officer kie ly confirms that ameral is simply not telling the truth . in a report filed one week afte r the incident , ameral stated that he left the bank minutes before 11:30 a.m. – which would ha ve meant he left well before hearing the radio transmission . pictures captured by the bank ’ s security video , submitted as evidence by the appointing authority , put both k iely and ameral in the bank at least until 11:38:10 a.m. , offering irrefutable evidence that ameral is not telling the truth about what time he walked out of the bank that morn ing . further , even officer kiely 14 testified before the commission that he saw officer ameral standing on the sidewalk outside the bank two seconds after he stepped into the road and fired his gun a t the speeding vehicle . in order for ameral ’ s version of events to be remotely true , he ( ameral ) would need to have gotten out of his car a nd walked or run 70 feet up cedar street toward highland avenue in two seconds . cognizant that his fellow officer ( ameral ) had been disciplined by management approximately one month earlier for leaving his sec tor without permission , officer kiely waited three days to fill out a report regarding th e incident , and once he did , failed to mention even once that officer ameral was present t hat morning at the bank , outside of his assigned sector . an appointing authority is well within its rights t o take disciplinary action when a police officer has “ a demonstrated willingness to f udge the truth in exigent circumstances ” because “ [ p ] olice work frequently ca lls upon officers to speak the truth when doing so might put into question a search or m ight embarrass a fellow officer. ” see town of falmouth v. civil service commission , 61 mass . app . ct. 796 , 801 ( 2004 ) ; citing city of cambridge , supra at 303 . by a preponderance of the evidence , the appointing authority has shown that officer kiely sought to conceal the fact that officer amera l was at the bank , out of his sector , when the incident in question occurred on january 1 8 , 2003 by failing to indicate that officer ameral was present in the written report he submitted to the somerville police department . in doing so , he was not truthful and h e violated the rules and regulations regarding truthfulness and filing accurate reports . while there is a strong suspicion that 15 kiely deliberately waited four days to file his rep ort in order to coordinate his response with ameral , which would support the charge related to kiely not filing a timely report , the appointing authority did not prove this . furth er , kiely was clearly shaken by the shooting that day , appropriately sought medical att ention and was out sick for two days after the incident , all mitigating factors in deter mining whether or not the report was filed in a timely manner . the underpinning of this case , however , is not whether or not the report in question was filed in a timely manner . r ather , the underlying question is whether or not the report was accurate , complete an d truthful . it was not . as such , the 15-day suspension should not be disturbed solely be cause the appointing authority failed to show that kiely ’ s report was untimely . the most troubling aspect of this case , however , is the untruthfulness of michael ameral . the irrefutable evidence , and even the testimony of kiely , show that ameral ’ s version of events regarding the morning of septembe r 18 , 2003 is simply not true . by a preponderance of the evidence , the appointing autho rity has shown that kiely was untruthful , falsified records , and was out of his s ector without permission that day . for all of the above-reasons , the appellants ’ appeals under docket numbers d-03-289 and d-03-292 are hereby dismissed . civil service commission ________________________________ christopher c. bowman , chairman by
